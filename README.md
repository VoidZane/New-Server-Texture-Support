Getting Texture On
------------

Download both files as they will both be needed (Sildurs-Vibrant-Shaders and Jehkobas Fantasy)

After downloading both locate em, next locate your .minecraft folder

you can find it by searching in your windows tab "%appdata%"

search it as a file and it should show a .minecraft folder

in .minecraft you need to find 2 folders to move the downloads to

first being Resource packs, the other being shaderpacks

You will want to move Jehkobas Fantasy to Ressource Packs

and you will want to move Sildurs-Vibrant-Shaders to Shader Pack

Getting The Best Version of Minecraft
----------------------------------------------------------
Now that you have the textures you will also want to download the minecraft version

this version is no different but it will help your game in running better and more optimized

downloading the Optifine 1.19.2 and open it

itll open a small window asking if you want to install, extract or cancel

double check that your auto selected folder is your in use .minecraft folder and not a random other one

this shouldnt be a problem unless you tried to download minecraft a lot

once you verified you can click install and wait the little bit while it works

after its done you can go to your minecraft launcher

select the version to play and you should see this new icon saying Optifine

thats your new optimized minecraft version

launch up the game with the new version, head into the server and have a good time
